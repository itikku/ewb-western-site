ewb-western-site
================

A clean, elegant landing page for viewers to learn more about EWB Western's events and workshops

How to manage content:

To ensure ease of maintenance for the site over the years, I have opted to load the site's data from files, as opposed to using a full blown database. The files are located in the folder 'resources/files'.

The following sections indicate how each file must be structured to ensure that the website correctly loads their data:

events.txt
==========
Name: Insert name of event here
Image: Specify the filename of an image (e.g. logo.jpg). This image MUST CURRENTLY EXIST in the resources folder
Date: Insert date of event here
Description: Insert the description here. DO NOT PRESS ENTER at any point while writing the description

Name: ...
*** Note: Ensure that there is a space between the colon and the first character of each section (i.e. : Blah, and not :Blah)

presentations.txt
=================
Name: Insert name of event here
Description: Insert the description here. DO NOT PRESS ENTER at any point while writing the description

Name: ...

*** Note: Ensure that there is a space between the colon and the first character of each section (i.e. : Blah, and not :Blah)
